# ![Vuejs Example App]

> Vue.js codebase containing listing examples (search, advance search, etc)

Project demo is available at http://www.synsoftglobal.net/vuejs-sample/

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Vue.js** including List operations, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Vue.js** community styleguides & best practices.
